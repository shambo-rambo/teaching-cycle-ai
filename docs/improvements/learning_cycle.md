# Teaching and Learning Cycle: Building Academic Stamina Through Structured Writing

## Framework Overview

This framework systematically builds students' academic writing capacity through explicit teaching and strong scaffolding. Rather than expecting students to produce complex writing independently, it guides them through five carefully structured stages that develop both content knowledge and writing expertise.

**Key Benefits:**
- Builds academic stamina for senior study (particularly IB preparation)
- Provides consistent approach across subjects
- Increases student confidence through explicit instruction
- Develops deep content knowledge alongside writing skills

## Stage 1: Building Knowledge of the Field (Week 1-2)

**Purpose:** Engage students with the topic and build shared understanding of key concepts, vocabulary, and ideas.

### In Class Activities:
- **Topic introduction** through multimedia, demonstrations, or provocations
- **Vocabulary building** - introduce key terms with definitions and examples
- **Class discussions** about prior knowledge and initial observations
- **Shared reading** of relevant texts, articles, or sources
- **Note-taking practice** using graphic organisers or structured templates
- **Interactive activities** - experiments, documentaries, group investigations

### At Home Activities:
- **Additional reading** from provided sources or textbook chapters
- **Vocabulary consolidation** - creating word maps or definition lists
- **Basic research** on assigned aspects of the topic
- **Reflection journal** - recording questions and initial thoughts

### Start Writing Early:
**In Class:** Have students write a **rough first draft** (10-15 minutes) based on what they know so far. This could be:
- Initial response to a question
- Bullet points of key ideas
- Mind map or outline
- First attempt at the topic

*Save this draft - students will revise it throughout the cycle*

## Stage 2: Supported Reading (Week 2-3)

**Purpose:** Guide students to read increasingly complex texts strategically, gathering information and ideas for their writing.

### In Class Activities:
**Modelled Reading:**
- Teacher demonstrates reading strategies using "think-aloud" technique
- Shows how to identify main ideas, make connections, and ask questions
- Models note-taking and annotation techniques

**Shared Reading:**
- Read key texts together as a class
- Discuss vocabulary in context
- Analyse relationship between text and images/diagrams
- Practice skimming, scanning, and close reading strategies

**Guided Reading:**
- Small group work with differentiated texts
- Teacher supports groups with specific reading challenges
- Focus on particular reading strategies relevant to the subject

### At Home Activities:
- **Independent reading** of assigned texts with specific focus questions
- **Note-taking** using techniques practised in class
- **Text annotation** - highlighting key information, writing questions in margins
- **Summary writing** - brief summaries of main points from readings

### Writing Development:
**In Class:** Students **revise their first draft** (10-15 minutes) incorporating new information from readings.

---

## Stage 3: Learning About the Genre (Week 3-4)

**Purpose:** Explicitly teach students the structure, purpose, and language features of the specific writing type they'll be producing.

### In Class Activities:
**Identify the Purpose:**
- Explain why this type of writing exists in your subject
- Show real-world examples (historical arguments, scientific reports, geographical explanations, etc.)

**Deconstruct Model Texts:**
- Examine high-quality examples of the genre
- Identify the typical stages/sections and their purposes
- Create class vocabulary for discussing text structure

**Analyse Language Features:**
- Examine how sentences are structured in this genre
- Identify key vocabulary and phrases typical of the writing type
- Practice using subject-specific language

### Subject-Specific Examples:
- **History:** Analyse how historical arguments present evidence and reasoning
- **Science:** Examine how experiment reports move from hypothesis to conclusion
- **English:** Study how analytical essays build and support arguments
- **Geography:** Look at how place descriptions or process explanations are organised

### At Home Activities:
- **Genre analysis** - students find and analyse additional examples
- **Language feature hunt** - identify examples of target language features in readings
- **Structure practice** - create outlines using the identified text structure

### Writing Development:
**In Class:** Students **restructure their draft** (15-20 minutes) to match the genre requirements they've learned.

---

## Stage 4: Supported Writing (Week 4-5)

**Purpose:** Provide intensive support as students compose their texts, with teacher guidance on language choices and structure.

### In Class Activities:
**Modelled Writing:**
- Teacher demonstrates writing process using "think-aloud"
- Shows decision-making about word choice, sentence structure, and organisation
- Models revision and editing strategies

**Joint Construction:**
- Class works together to write part of a text
- Teacher guides process while incorporating student suggestions
- Focus on crafting effective paragraphs and transitions

**Guided Writing:**
- Teacher conferences with small groups or individuals
- Provides specific feedback on structure, language, and content
- Addresses common challenges as they arise

### At Home Activities:
- **Vocabulary development** - expanding word choice for the topic
- **Sentence practice** - combining simple sentences, varying sentence length
- **Research** (if needed) - gathering additional specific information
- **Peer feedback** - sharing drafts with classmates for initial responses

### Writing Development:
**In Class:** Students **continue developing their draft** (20-25 minutes) with teacher support and peer collaboration.

---

## Stage 5: Independent Writing (Week 5-6)

**Purpose:** Students take full control of their writing, demonstrating their knowledge and skills independently.

### In Class Activities:
**Independent Writing Time:**
- Extended writing sessions (30-45 minutes)
- Students work on final drafts with minimal teacher intervention
- Access to resources, dictionaries, and reference materials
- Quiet, focused writing environment

**Peer Review Sessions:**
- Structured peer feedback using specific criteria
- Focus on content, structure, and language features learned
- Students practise giving and receiving constructive feedback

### At Home Activities:
- **Editing and proofreading** - checking spelling, punctuation, and grammar
- **Final formatting** - ensuring presentation meets requirements
- **Self-reflection** - evaluating their own learning and writing development

### Assessment:
Students submit their final text along with their drafts from earlier stages, demonstrating their learning journey.

## Implementation Guidelines

### Getting Started:
1. **Choose one key writing type** for your subject (e.g., historical argument, scientific explanation, analytical essay)
2. **Start with shorter cycles** (4-5 weeks) and build up
3. **Focus on 2-3 key language features** rather than trying to cover everything
4. **Use authentic examples** from your subject area

### Building Academic Stamina:
- **Week 1-2:** 10-15 minute writing sessions
- **Week 3-4:** 15-25 minute writing sessions  
- **Week 5-6:** 30-45 minute independent writing
- **Gradually increase** expectations throughout the year

### Cross-Curricular Consistency:
- Use the **same process** in all subjects
- Share **common vocabulary** for discussing writing (genre, purpose, audience, structure)
- **Coordinate timing** so students aren't overwhelmed across subjects

### Supporting Student Success:
- **Save all drafts** - students can see their improvement
- **Celebrate progress** - acknowledge growth in academic stamina
- **Explicit criteria** - students know what success looks like
- **Regular conferencing** - provide individual support as needed

## Adapting for Your Subject

**Consider:**
- What is the most important type of writing students need to master in your subject?
- What real-world purposes does this writing serve?
- What are the key language features that make writing effective in your discipline?
- How can you connect the writing to your existing curriculum content?

**Remember:** The goal is building academic stamina and writing expertise systematically, not rushing to final products. The process matters as much as the outcome.
