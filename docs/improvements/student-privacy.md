# Student Identity Encryption Policy
## Privacy Protection for AI-Powered Educational Platform

---

## üîí **CORE REQUIREMENT**

**All student personal identifying information must be encrypted before being sent to any AI systems (Claude, OpenAI, etc.) for lesson analysis, differentiation, or recommendation generation.**

---

## üéØ **POLICY OBJECTIVE**

Protect student privacy while enabling AI-powered educational intelligence by ensuring no personally identifiable information (PII) is exposed to external AI services during lesson processing and recommendation generation.

---

## üìã **WHAT MUST BE ENCRYPTED**

### **Always Encrypt:**
- **Student Names**: "John Smith" ‚Üí "Student_A7F9" or encrypted hash
- **Student Numbers**: "STU2024001", "12345678" ‚Üí Anonymous AI identifier
- **Student IDs**: Any school-specific student identification numbers
- **Personal Details**: Birthdate, address, contact information (if stored)
- **Family Information**: Parent names, emergency contacts, family details

### **Why Not Use Real Student Numbers for AI:**
- **Still PII**: Student numbers can be traced back to individuals
- **Pattern Recognition**: Sequential numbers (2024001, 2024002) could reveal class composition
- **Database Linking**: Anyone with partial school access could potentially match numbers to students
- **Compliance Risk**: Many privacy frameworks consider student numbers as identifiable information

### **Learning Data That Stays Functional:**
- **Learning Support Tags**: ADHD, Dyslexia, ESL (these are descriptive, not identifying)
- **Accommodation Requirements**: "Movement breaks needed", "Extended time", "Visual supports"
- **Academic Performance Indicators**: Grade levels, assessment scores (anonymized)
- **Learning Preferences**: Learning style indicators, subject strengths/challenges

---

## ü§ñ **AI PROCESSING APPROACH**

### **Data Sent to AI Services:**
```
Class Context for AI Processing:
- Subject: IB History DP
- Year Level: DP1
- Class Size: 23 students
- Student Learning Profiles:
  * Student_A7F9: ADHD, requires movement breaks, visual learner
  * Student_B2K5: ESL, needs vocabulary support, peer collaboration
  * Student_C9X1: Dyslexia, requires audio support, extended time
  * Student_D4M8: Gifted, needs extension activities, critical thinking focus
  
Framework Requirements:
- Learning Intentions & Success Criteria (school priority)
- IB DP History assessment criteria
- Differentiation for learning support needs
```

### **What AI Never Sees:**
- Actual student names: "John Smith", "Mary Johnson"
- Real student numbers: "STU2024001", "12345678" 
- Student ID numbers: Any school-specific identification
- Personal family information
- Any identifying information that could link back to real students

### **Anonymous Identifier Strategy:**
- **Create separate AI-only IDs**: "Student_A7F9", "Student_B2K5" (no relation to real student numbers)
- **Consistent per session**: Same student gets same AI identifier within a lesson/class context
- **No pattern correlation**: AI identifiers have no relationship to real student numbers or enrollment data
- **Completely reversible mapping**: System can always connect AI recommendations back to real students for teacher display

---

## üîß **TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION**

### **Encryption Method:**
- **One-way hashing** for student identifiers sent to AI
- **Reversible encryption** for internal system use (teacher viewing, reporting)
- **Consistent hashing** so same student always gets same anonymous ID per session

### **Example Implementation:**
```javascript
// Internal system stores both encrypted and readable data
StudentProfile {
  studentId: "uuid-internal-only",
  encryptedName: "encrypted_data_here", // For internal use
  encryptedStudentNumber: "encrypted_number_here", // School student number encrypted
  aiIdentifier: "Student_A7F9", // Completely separate anonymous ID for AI
  realName: "John Smith", // Only visible to teachers/admin in UI
  realStudentNumber: "STU2024001", // Only visible to teachers/admin in UI
  learningSupport: {
    tags: ["ADHD", "Movement_breaks"],
    accommodations: ["Visual organizers", "Reduced text density"]
  }
}

// Data sent to AI (NO real student numbers)
AIProcessingData {
  classId: "encrypted_class_id",
  students: [
    {
      studentRef: "Student_A7F9", // Anonymous identifier (NOT real student number)
      learningSupport: ["ADHD", "Movement_breaks"],
      accommodations: ["Visual organizers", "Reduced text density"]
    }
  ]
}
```

### **System Architecture:**
1. **Teacher Interface**: Shows real student names for classroom management
2. **AI Processing Layer**: Receives only encrypted identifiers and learning data
3. **Result Mapping**: AI recommendations mapped back to real students for teacher use
4. **Audit Trail**: Log what data was sent to AI (encrypted versions only)

---

## üéì **EDUCATIONAL VALUE PRESERVATION**

### **AI Can Still Provide:**
- **Personalized Differentiation**: "Student_A7F9 needs movement breaks during this 60-minute lesson"
- **Learning Support Recommendations**: "For ADHD students, break this text analysis into 3 shorter segments"
- **Extension Suggestions**: "Student_D4M8 should receive additional critical thinking questions"
- **Class-wide Adaptations**: "This class has 5 ESL students - include visual vocabulary support"

### **Teacher Receives:**
- **Named Recommendations**: "John needs movement breaks during this lesson"
- **Individual Adaptations**: Specific suggestions for each student by name
- **Class Overview**: Understanding of all student needs in readable format
- **Implementation Guidance**: How to apply AI suggestions to specific students

---

## üìä **DATA FLOW EXAMPLE**

### **Step 1: Teacher Creates Lesson**
```
Teacher Input:
- Lesson: "Causes of World War I analysis"
- Class: IB History DP1, 23 students
- Duration: 90 minutes
```

### **Step 2: System Encrypts Student Data**
```
AI Payload:
{
  lessonContext: "World War I causes analysis, 90 minutes",
  classProfile: {
    subject: "IB History DP",
    yearLevel: "DP1", 
    size: 23,
    students: [
      {ref: "Student_A7F9", needs: ["ADHD", "movement_breaks"]},
      {ref: "Student_B2K5", needs: ["ESL", "vocabulary_support"]},
      {ref: "Student_C9X1", needs: ["dyslexia", "audio_support"]}
    ]
  }
}
```

### **Step 3: AI Generates Recommendations**
```
AI Response:
{
  lesson_adaptations: {
    "Student_A7F9": "Include 2-minute movement break at 30 and 60 minute marks",
    "Student_B2K5": "Provide vocabulary list with key terms: alliance, imperialism, nationalism",
    "Student_C9X1": "Include audio recording of primary source documents"
  },
  class_modifications: [
    "Break 90-minute lesson into 3x30-minute segments",
    "Use visual timeline for chronological understanding"
  ]
}
```

### **Step 4: System Maps Back to Real Students**
```
Teacher Interface Shows:
{
  "John Smith": "Include 2-minute movement break at 30 and 60 minute marks",
  "Maria Garcia": "Provide vocabulary list with key terms: alliance, imperialism, nationalism", 
  "Alex Thompson": "Include audio recording of primary source documents"
}
```
