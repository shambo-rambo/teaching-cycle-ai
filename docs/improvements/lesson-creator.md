# Smart Questioning Feature - IB History Enhanced Implementation Guide

## üéØ CORE CONCEPT
Transform lesson planning from overwhelming choices to strategic selections through smart tagging and targeted questions

## üìã OVERALL FLOW

```pseudocode
WHEN teacher starts lesson planning:
  1. TAG lesson context (Paper 1/2/3, syllabus topic)
  2. SELECT key priorities via tick boxes (not open questions)
  3. SYSTEM generates activities split by IB cycle (Inquiry/Action/Reflection)
  4. TEACHER selects at least one from each category
  5. CREATE targeted lesson plan with IB standards built-in
```

## üèóÔ∏è ENHANCED COMPONENTS

### 1. Smart Tagging System (NEW)
```pseudocode
INITIAL TAGGING:
{
  paper: "Paper 1 | Paper 2 | Paper 3",
  syllabusSection: [dropdown of IB topics],
  duration: "90 min | 180 min",
  hasPreReading: boolean (checkbox)
}

// This pre-determines many requirements:
IF Paper 1: focus on source analysis, OPCVL
IF Paper 2: focus on essay skills, comparison
IF Paper 3: focus on regional depth, detail
```

### 2. Strategic Tick Box Selections
```pseudocode
CONCEPTUAL FOCUS (select 1-2):
‚ñ° Change and Continuity
‚ñ° Causation (short/long term)
‚ñ° Consequence (intended/unintended)
‚ñ° Significance
‚ñ° Perspectives
‚ñ° Power and Authority
‚ñ° Conflict and Cooperation

ATL SKILLS PRIORITY (select 1-2):
‚ñ° Critical Thinking
‚ñ° Source Analysis
‚ñ° Research Skills
‚ñ° Communication (written)
‚ñ° Communication (oral)
‚ñ° Collaboration
‚ñ° Self-Management
‚ñ° Transfer Skills

TEACHING PREFERENCES:
‚ñ° Flipped Learning (30 min pre-reading)
‚ñ° Full In-Class Instruction
‚ñ° Hybrid Approach

ASSESSMENT FOCUS (select one):
‚ñ° Formative - Skill Building
‚ñ° Summative - Paper Practice
‚ñ° Diagnostic - Check Understanding
‚ñ° Peer/Self Assessment

HISTORICAL THINKING (select primary):
‚ñ° Evidence-Based Reasoning
‚ñ° Chronological Thinking
‚ñ° Comparison/Contextualization
‚ñ° Historical Argumentation
‚ñ° Interpretation/Synthesis
```

### 3. IB Cycle Activity Generation
```pseudocode
ACTIVITY_GENERATION_LOGIC:
  BASED ON: tags + selections
  GENERATE: 2-3 activities per IB phase
  
  INQUIRY ACTIVITIES (Choose 1):
    - Provocative questions
    - Source mysteries
    - Concept exploration
    - Problem posing
    
  ACTION ACTIVITIES (Choose 1-2):
    - Collaborative analysis
    - Debate/discussion
    - Research tasks
    - Writing workshops
    - Skill application
    
  REFLECTION ACTIVITIES (Choose 1):
    - Synthesis tasks
    - Self-assessment
    - Connection making
    - Exit strategies
```

### 4. SmartQuestioningService (REVISED)
```pseudocode
CLASS SmartQuestioningService:
  
  FUNCTION processTagsAndSelections(tagData, selections):
    INPUT: {
      tags: {paper, syllabus, duration, flipped},
      conceptualFocus: [selected concepts],
      atlSkills: [selected skills],
      assessmentFocus: selected,
      historicalThinking: selected
    }
    
    GENERATE activities organized by IB cycle:
    OUTPUT: {
      inquiryOptions: [2-3 activities],
      actionOptions: [3-4 activities],
      reflectionOptions: [2-3 activities],
      rationale: "Why these activities match your needs"
    }
  
  FUNCTION validateLessonBalance(selectedActivities):
    ENSURE: at least 1 from each IB phase
    ENSURE: activities flow logically
    ENSURE: time allocations work
    RETURN: balanced lesson structure
```

### 5. Enhanced AI Prompts
```pseudocode
IB_CYCLE_ACTIVITY_PROMPT = `
You are an IB History DP expert creating targeted activities.

CONTEXT PROVIDED:
- Paper type: {determines skill focus}
- Syllabus topic: {content area}
- Conceptual focus: {big ideas to explore}
- ATL priorities: {skills to develop}
- Assessment type: {formative/summative focus}
- Teaching approach: {flipped/traditional}

GENERATE:
- 2-3 INQUIRY activities (opening hooks, questions)
- 3-4 ACTION activities (main learning tasks)
- 2-3 REFLECTION activities (synthesis, assessment)

Each activity must:
- Fit the IB paper requirements
- Develop selected conceptual understanding
- Build chosen ATL skills
- Align with assessment focus
- Work within time constraints
- Include brief rationale
`
```

## üîÑ IMPROVED UI FLOW

### Step 1: Smart Tagging
```pseudocode
SCREEN: Lesson Context
- Dropdown: Select Paper (1/2/3)
- Dropdown: Select Syllabus Topic
- Radio: Lesson Duration
- Checkbox: Using Flipped Learning?
[NEXT ‚Üí]
```

### Step 2: Quick Selections
```pseudocode
SCREEN: Learning Priorities (All Tick Boxes)
- Conceptual Focus (pick 1-2)
- ATL Skills (pick 1-2)
- Assessment Focus (pick 1)
- Historical Thinking (pick primary)
[GENERATE ACTIVITIES ‚Üí]
```

### Step 3: Activity Selection by IB Cycle
```pseudocode
SCREEN: Build Your Lesson

INQUIRY PHASE (10-15 min)
‚óã Provocative Question: "Why did peace fail..."
‚óã Source Mystery: "Analyze this cartoon..."
[Rationale shown on hover]

ACTION PHASE (65-70 min)
‚óã Source Analysis Workshop: "OPCVL stations..."
‚óã Structured Debate: "Was appeasement justified..."
‚óã Collaborative Timeline: "Cause mapping..."
[Select 1-2, time auto-calculated]

REFLECTION PHASE (10-15 min)
‚óã Exit Ticket: "Self-assess using success criteria"
‚óã Synthesis Paragraph: "Most significant factor..."
[Rationale shown on hover]

[GENERATE FULL LESSON ‚Üí]
```

## üìä REVISED API STRUCTURE

```pseudocode
POST /api/lessons/ib-history/create
  INPUT: {
    tags: {paper, topic, duration, flipped},
    priorities: {concepts, skills, assessment, thinking},
    selectedActivities: {inquiry[], action[], reflection[]}
  }
  OUTPUT: Complete IB-aligned lesson plan

GET /api/lessons/ib-history/activities
  INPUT: tags + priorities
  OUTPUT: Activities organized by IB cycle
```

## üéØ IB-SPECIFIC SUCCESS CRITERIA

```pseudocode
LESSON QUALITY METRICS:
‚úì Includes all three IB phases (Inquiry‚ÜíAction‚ÜíReflection)
‚úì Develops specific paper skills
‚úì Addresses selected conceptual understanding
‚úì Builds chosen ATL skills
‚úì Aligns with IB assessment criteria
‚úì Incorporates historical thinking
‚úì Promotes international mindedness
‚úì Includes differentiation options

USER EXPERIENCE METRICS:
‚úì Setup time: < 3 minutes
‚úì Selections: mostly tick boxes
‚úì Activities: pre-filtered by context
‚úì Rationales: clear and visible
```

## üß† INTELLIGENCE ENHANCEMENTS

### Context-Aware Filtering
```pseudocode
IF Paper 1 selected:
  PRIORITIZE: source analysis, OPCVL activities
  INCLUDE: variety of source types
  FOCUS: 4-5 sources maximum

IF Paper 2 selected:
  PRIORITIZE: essay planning, comparison
  INCLUDE: thesis development
  FOCUS: argumentation skills

IF Paper 3 selected:
  PRIORITIZE: detailed knowledge, regional focus
  INCLUDE: case studies
  FOCUS: depth over breadth
```

### Flipped Learning Adjustments
```pseudocode
IF flipped_learning = true:
  INQUIRY: Quick knowledge check (5 min)
  ACTION: All application/analysis (75 min)
  REFLECTION: Synthesis only (10 min)
  
ELSE:
  INQUIRY: Full introduction (15 min)
  ACTION: Mixed content/skills (65 min)
  REFLECTION: Standard close (10 min)
```

## üîß IMPLEMENTATION ADVANTAGES

1. **Faster Setup**: Tick boxes instead of typing
2. **IB Alignment**: Built into every choice
3. **Balanced Lessons**: Automatic IB cycle structure
4. **Clear Rationales**: Teachers understand why
5. **Flexibility**: Still allows customization
6. **Standards Met**: All IB requirements included

This approach maintains your innovative efficiency while ensuring every lesson meets IB History DP standards through smart design rather than lengthy questionnaires.
