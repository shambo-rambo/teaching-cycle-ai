3. Executives create frameworks (IB DP + High Impact Teaching, Learning Support)
4. Admin imports student data with learning support tags
5. Teachers create class profiles using imported student lists
6. Teacher creates lesson in lesson creator
7. System pulls class profile data (students, frameworks, scope & sequence)
8. AI applies frameworks as system prompts
9. AI suggests differentiation based on student learning support profiles
10. Teacher receives framework-compliant lesson with differentiation options

**This completes the organizational hierarchy shell ready for your existing lesson analyzer/creator integration.**
